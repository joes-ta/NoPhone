# NoPhone

NoLib + PinePhone -> NoPhone

If you're looking for a mobile phone, come back in a few years.

This is likely the last time the word "linux" will be used here.

The goal is to build a self-contained development/application environment from scratch. 

The PinePhone looks like a great hardware platform to play with. That's it. I'm only interested in the PinePhone as hardware assembled in a sleek package awaiting it's first instructions. CPU, RAM, Touchscreen, cameras, WiFi, Modem, Magnetometer, Ambient light / Proximity	Sensor, Accelerometer / Gyroscope, Vibration motor and LED all for whatever can be imagined.
